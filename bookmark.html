[Verse 1]
I can't be your love
Look, it’s too trivial for you now
Oh, my life is fallin' apart
Maybe no one will notice if I disappear

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I’ll give you all my life, my seasons

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I can't be your love
'Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life
While the leaves withered away
And grew again
You have gone far away
I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here

[Chorus]
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life, my seasons
By your side, I’ll be your sеasons

[Outro]
My love</pre>

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Verse 2]
Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Outro]
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner (Wanna be yours)
Breathin' in your dust (Wanna be yours)
I wanna be your Ford Cortina (Wanna be yours)
I will never rust (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)
I just wanna be yours (Wanna be yours)</pre>

[Verse 1]
Your morning eyes I could stare like watching stars
I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
You'll be mine, would you mind if I took your hand tonight?
Know you're all that I want this life

[Chorus]
I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me?

[Verse 2]
My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe, so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you I love you more
It's stuck with you forever, so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you

[Chorus]
I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The ocean's colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me? </pre>
